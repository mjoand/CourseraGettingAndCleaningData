## The Raw Data Set

The data corresponds to the recordings of a series of experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)  wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
Using the smartphones's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, measurements of 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at 
a constant rate of 50Hz. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding
windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window).From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables
from the time and frequency domain.
